# Forest_Fires_Greece-2000-2021-
A quick survey on Forest Fires in Greece in the 21st Century.
We present basic visuals about the Forest fires and their impact on land loss 
and we define and focus on the phenomenon of Megafires. Furthermore, we briefly 
analyze the imporatnce of Fire Prevention and we investigate funding imbalances 
existing in funding policies in Greece between Fire Prevention and Fire Suppression.

Through this quick presentation we wish to uncover the importnace of Fire Prevention
through arguing that Fire Suppression is not sufficient enough for dealing with the 
increasingly dangerous fire seasons in Greece.

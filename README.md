# A Brief Intro to the Survey
This is a survey presentation on the Forest Fires in Greece throughout the 21st Century, so far.
We demonstrate the aggregate land damage through multiple visualizations followed by investigation 
of the impact under a regional perspective. Moreover, we define and analyze the phenomenon of Megafires and 
their grave consequences on land and people's lives.
Moving forward, we briefly analyze the crucial role of Fire Prevention while searching and raising concern for 
funding imbalances between Fire Prevention and Fire Suppression policy-making.

In conclusion, this presentation aims to highlight the importance of Fire Prevention emphasizing that Fire Suppression 
is a necessary but not sufficient strategy for dealing with the increasingly dangerous fire seasons in Greece that usually 
culminate in irreparable, destructive Megafires.
